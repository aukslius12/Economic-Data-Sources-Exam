# Economic Data Sources Exam
Exam exercises for Economic Data Sources course. Everything is in lithuanian (except code). Final grade: 10/10 (sadly, was placed 2/30, due to my RMarkDown failing to process lithuanian letters (ąčęąčšįęąė). Everything was done in 3 full days.

**Goals**:
  * Scrape 600.000~ rows of data from raw HTML with variable data formats;

  * Comment, describe and organize everything - focus on making code readable and sustainable;
  * Make the script robust - scrape from any OS, anywhere (as long as it has libraries);
  * And of course, aim for perfection.
